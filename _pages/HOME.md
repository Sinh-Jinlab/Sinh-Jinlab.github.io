excerpt: 'The long-term goal of **MOT (PI: JIN Wenfei)**  is to develop efficient personalized treatment for cancers based on patients’ genetic background. In the near future, the lab will focus on investigating genetic/epigenetic heterogeneity and micro-evolution of cancer cells using single cell sequencing related technologies.'
